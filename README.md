# Game review:
The game is built in four stages, first stage is the game main menu that holds two parts of sections as a primary and secondary. The secondary is the second stage which is the tutorial in the game and it shows the player how to understand the Arabic Alphabet ordering and its pronunciation. The primary rule in the game is the Letters Board and it is the third stage of the game; the letter appears to the player in a way that he or she can choose which letter to start with, however, the player is recommended to start from the first letter. The fourth stage is the drawing board stage, the player must follow the path of the letter in order to complete the writing letter correctly.

# How to play:
The play must draw over the path that where the numbers and the arrows point to. Once the player finishes writing the letter, he or she will see a dialog that informs the passing result. Then the player can choose to go to the next letter or the previous.



*Note: the numbers are presented in Arabic language, however the game board has the hint for these numbers, so the players do not struggle.

# Controls:
The control in this game is basically mouse events, the player clicks and holds the mouse to draw the letter and release to end the drawing path. If there was a mistake such as drawing outside the path, the tracing path that built in the game will automatically erase the drawing and the player must start drawing again
